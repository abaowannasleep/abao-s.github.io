# Renscently Research
• In 2021, research was conducted on the Fringe Projection Profilometry (FPP) technique for triangulation measurement. This approach employed binary-encoded sinusoidal fringe patterns by genetic algorithm to reduce accuracy loss and accelerate the measurement process. For more details, please refer to the paper titled ” An Optimizing Diffusion Kernel-Based Binary Encoding Strategy With Genetic Algorithm for Fringe Projection Profilometry,” available at [[PDF]](https://abaowannasleep.github.io/files/An_Optimizing_Diffusion_Kernel-Based_Binary_Encoding_Strategy_With_Genetic_Algorithm_for_Fringe_Projection_Profilometry.pdf.pdf) [[DOI]](https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2022.3168900)

Additionally, research was carried out on industrial defect detection using a lightweight network architecture, enabling 2D defect detection and localization in various industrial scenarios.

• In 2022, research was conducted on solving high-dynamic complex surface topography in microscopic 3D measurements. The study employed a passive vision method called Shape from Focus (SFF) for measuring metal microdevices. Global optimization based on MRF is used for the  restoration of the depth map. For more details, please refer to the paper titled ” Improved shape-from-focus reconstruction for high dynamic range freedom surface,” available at [[PDF]](https://abaowannasleep.github.io/files/Improved_shape-from-focus_reconstruction_for_high_dynamic_range_freedom_surface.pdf) [[DOI]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.optlaseng.2023.107784) [[GitHub]](https://github.com/abaowannasleep/shape-from-focus).

• In 2023, research was conducted on the precise calibration method for bi-telecentric cameras in a microscopic system. The study focused on developing accurate calibration techniques for dual-camera setups to improve measurement accuracy. 
Additionally, research was carried out on structured light measurement techniques in coaxial configurations.
