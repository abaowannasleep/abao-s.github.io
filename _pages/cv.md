# Renscently Research
• In 2021, research was conducted on the Fringe Projection Profilometry (FPP) technique for triangulation measurement. This approach employed binary-encoded sinusoidal fringe patterns to reduce accuracy loss and accelerate the measurement process. For more details, please refer to the paper titled ” An Optimizing Diffusion Kernel-Based Binary Encoding Strategy With Genetic Algorithm for Fringe Projection Profilometry,” available at [[PDF]](https://abaowannasleep.github.io/files/An_Optimizing_Diffusion_Kernel-Based_Binary_Encoding_Strategy_With_Genetic_Algorithm_for_Fringe_Projection_Profilometry.pdf.pdf) [[DOI]](https://doi.org/10.1109/TIM.2022.3168900)

Additionally, research was carried out on industrial defect detection using a lightweight network architecture, enabling 2D defect detection and localization in various industrial scenarios.

• In 2022, research was conducted on solving high-dynamic complex surface topography in microscopic 3D measurements. The study employed a passive vision method called Shape from Focus (SFF) for measuring metal microdevices. For more details, please refer to the paper titled ” Improved shape-from-focus reconstruction for high dynamic range freedom surface,” available at [[PDF]](https://abaowannasleep.github.io/files/Improved_shape-from-focus_reconstruction_for_high_dynamic_range_freedom_surface.pdf) [[DOI]](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.optlaseng.2023.107784) [[GitHub]](https://github.com/abaowannasleep/shape-from-focus).

• In 2023, research was conducted on the precise calibration method for bi-telecentric cameras in a microscopic system. The study focused on developing accurate calibration techniques for dual-camera setups to improve measurement accuracy. 
Additionally, research was carried out on structured light measurement techniques in coaxial configurations.
