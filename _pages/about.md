Welcome to my page! This is Zhoumiao He, a third-year doctoral student in College of Computer Science, Sichuan University, under the supervision of Prof. [Jianwei Zhang](https://vs.scu.edu.cn/info/1062/1369.htm) .      

My research interests include **three-dimensional topography**, **complex surface characterization**; and **computational imaging**. I am currently very interested in the study of complex microdevice morphology recovery methods, welcome to exchange advice!
