Welcome to my page! This is Zhoumiao He, a third-year doctoral student in the College of Computer Science, at Sichuan University, under the supervision of Prof. [Jianwei Zhang](https://vs.scu.edu.cn/info/1062/1369.htm).      

My research interests include **three-dimensional topography**, **complex surface characterization**; and **computational imaging**. 
I am currently very interested in the measurement methods of complex microdevice morphology(as shown below), welcome to exchange advice!

The surface has HDR properties because of the metal material, as well as the light source obstruction and mutual reflection caused by the deep grooves.

Traveling is my favorite, and I enjoy interacting with friends from different places. The most beautiful scenery is always on the road.
