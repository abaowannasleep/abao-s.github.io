Welcome to my page! This is Zhoumiao He, a third-year doctoral student in the College of Computer Science, at Sichuan University, under the supervision of Prof. [Jianwei Zhang](https://vs.scu.edu.cn/info/1062/1369.htm).      

My research interests include **three-dimensional topography**, **complex surface characterization**; and **computational imaging**. 
I am currently very interested in the measurement methods of complex microdevice morphology(as shown below), welcome to exchange advice!

$$ The surface has HDR properties because of the metal material, as well as the light source obstruction and mutual reflection caused by the deep grooves.$$
